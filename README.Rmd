# Travis-CI API Client Package #

**travisci** is a simple client package for the [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/) [REST API](http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#overview). It can control containerized builds of R packages and other software projects as part of a continuous integration workflow.

## Installation ##

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/travisci)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=travisci)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/travisci.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/travisci) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/travisci/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/travisci?branch=master)

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version from GitHub, run the following:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("cloudyr/travisci")
```

## Code Examples ##

To use the Travis-CI API, you will need a Github account and an authentication key. That authentication key will be used temporarily by the Travis-CI API to generate a further access key that will authenticate subsequent API requests. To do this, you'll need to store a GitHub token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. **travisci** then uses this to populate a `TRAVIS_CI_TOKEN` environment variable, which will be used for subsequent authentications.

To obtain a GitHub token, you can do the following, replacing "username" and "password" with your GitHub login details:

```R
auth_travis("username", "password")

# or, if you already have a GitHub token stored:
auth_travis()
```

A token can also be created [via the browser](https://github.com/settings/tokens). `auth_travis()` will, as a side effect, store the Travis-CI token received into the `TRAVIS_CI_TOKEN` environment variable.
